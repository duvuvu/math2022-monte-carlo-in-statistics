## Authors
This project was carried by:
- Duy Vu DINH

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project of the MATH2022 course.

## Project
The project applies Monte Carlo simulation techniques to study and generate values from the Beta distribution using various random number generation methods, including:

* Inverse Transform Sampling
* Transformation Methods for integer shape parameters
* Gamma-based Beta generation
* Acceptâ€“Reject algorithms with uniform and beta instrumental distributions
* Bayesian applications (conjugate priors for the Negative Binomial distribution)
* Parameter estimation via Method of Moments (MOM) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
* Runtime and accuracy comparisons between methods
